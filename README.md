# 🐭️ Mousehunt - Journal Privacy

A Userscript for [MouseHunt](https://mousehuntgame.com) that hides usernames from the journal entries on the journal page.

> [!TIP]
> You should install [MouseHunt Improved](https://github.com/MHCommunity/mousehunt-improved) instead of this script, as it includes this functionality and tons more!


## Installation

Install via [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/453301-mousehunt-journal-privacy).

*You must have [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or another userscript manager installed.*
